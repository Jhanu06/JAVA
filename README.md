# â˜• JAVA Concepts, OOPs & DSA Practice

Welcome to my Java learning and practice repository!  
This repo includes everything from **Java fundamentals** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** â€” all explained with clear code examples and hands-on practice.

---

## ðŸ“˜ What's Covered

### ðŸ”¹ Core Java
- Data Types, Variables, Operators
- Conditional Statements (if, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Arrays and String Manipulation
- Methods and Recursion
- Exception Handling (try-catch-finally, throws, throw)

### ðŸ”¹ Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors (default, parameterized, overloading, chaining)
- Inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical)
- Method Overloading and Overriding
- Abstraction (using abstract classes and interfaces)
- Polymorphism (compile-time & run-time)
- Encapsulation (getters/setters, access modifiers)

### ðŸ”¹ Intermediate & Advanced Topics
- Wrapper Classes & Autoboxing
- Static Keyword (methods, blocks, variables)
- Inner Classes (static & non-static)
- Final Keyword (variables, methods, classes)
- `this` and `super` keywords
- Packages and Access Control
- Java Collections Framework (ArrayList, HashMap, etc.)
- File Handling (FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, etc.)
- Multithreading Basics (Thread class, Runnable interface)

### ðŸ”¹ Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
This repo also includes a dedicated **`DSA/` folder** with practice code on:

- Arrays & Strings
- Searching & Sorting
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Stack & Queue
- Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

## ðŸŽ¯ Why this Repository?

- To reinforce each Java & DSA concept with **real code examples**
- To provide a strong foundation for **interviews and coding rounds**
- To serve as a **quick revision source**
- To track my personal Java + DSA progress from beginner to advanced

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Code

> Make sure you have Java installed. You can download it from [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

### Steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the folder containing `.java` files
3. Compile the Java file:
